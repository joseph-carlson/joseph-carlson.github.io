Shoutout to {{< newtablink url="https://futo.org/" text="FUTO" >}} and {{< newtablink url="https://consumerrights.wiki/Main_Page" text="CATF (Consumer Action Task Force Wiki)">}}!


I've been a long-time subscriber of Louis Rossmann's YouTube channel for his outspoken stance on the consumer right to repair, and more recently, consumer rights across all industries. 

With his online media presence, Louis Rossmann has brought FUTO into the spotlight to support the development of new and existing technologies that provide alternatives to products developed by big tech. You can read more about it here:

After years of fighting the good fight with the Repair Preservation Group, Louis Rossman started the Consumer Action Task Force Wiki as a means to crowdsource people's knowledge into an indisputable archive of cold, hard facts. You can read more about it here:

If you are willing and able to contribute, please do so. Every contribution to this crowdsourced wiki helps.
